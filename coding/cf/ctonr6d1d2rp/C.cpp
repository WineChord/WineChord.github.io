CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) C. Colorful Table 

You are given two integers n and k. You are also given an array of 
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of size n. It is known that for all 1 \leq 
i \leq n, 1 \leq a_i \leq k.

Define a two-dimensional array b of size n \times n as follows: b_{i, j} = 
\min(a_i, a_j). Represent array b as a square, where the upper left cell 
is b_{1, 1}, rows are numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n, and columns 
are numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Let the color of a cell be 
the number written in it (for a cell with coordinates (i, j), this is 
b_{i, j}).

For each color from 1 to k, find the smallest rectangle in the array b 
containing all cells of this color. Output the sum of width and height of 
this rectangle.
