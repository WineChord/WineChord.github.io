CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) F. Lazy Numbers 

You are given positive integers n and k. For each number from 1 to n, we 
write its representation in the number system with base k (without leading 
zeros) and then sort the resulting array in lexicographic order as 
strings. In the sorted array, we number the elements from 1 to n (i.e., 
indexing starts from 1). Find the number of values i such that the 
representation of number i is at the i-th position in the sorted array of 
representations.

Examples of representations: 1 in any number system is equal to 1, 7 with 
k = 3 is written as 21, and 81 with k = 9 is written as 100.
