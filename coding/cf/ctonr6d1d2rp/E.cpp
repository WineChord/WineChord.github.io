CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) E. Another MEX Problem 

You are given an array of integers a of size n. You can choose a set of 
non-overlapping subarrays of the given array (note that some elements may 
be not included in any subarray, this is allowed). For each selected 
subarray, calculate the MEX of its elements, and then calculate the <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">bitwise XOR

 of all the obtained MEX values. What is the maximum bitwise XOR that can 
be obtained?

The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative 
integer that does not belong to the array. For instance: 

 The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, because 0 does not belong to the array. 

 The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 
does not. 

 The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4, because 0, 1, 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 
4 does not.
