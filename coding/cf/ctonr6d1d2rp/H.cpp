CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) H. Standard Graph Problem 

You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. Each 
vertex in the graph can be either highlighted or normal. Initially, all 
vertices are normal. The cost of the graph is defined as the minimum sum 
of edge weights that need to be selected so that from each normal vertex 
one can reach at least one highlighted vertex using the selected edges 
only. If it is not possible to select the edges, the cost is -1 instead.

Your task is to compute the cost of the graph after each of the q queries. 
The queries can be of two types: 

 +\;v_i makes vertex v_i highlighted; it is guaranteed that the vertex is 
normal before the query. 

 -\;v_i makes vertex v_i normal; it is guaranteed that the vertex is 
highlighted before the query. 



Output the cost of the graph after each of the q queries.
