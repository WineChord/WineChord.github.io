CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) D. Prefix Purchase 

You have an array a of size n, initially filled with zeros (a_1 = a_2 = 
\ldots = a_n = 0). You also have an array of integers c of size n.

Initially, you have k coins. By paying c_i coins, you can add 1 to all 
elements of the array a from the first to the i-th element (a_j 
\mathrel{+}= 1 for all 1 \leq j \leq i). You can buy any c_i any number of 
times. A purchase is only possible if k \geq c_i, meaning that at any 
moment k \geq 0 must hold true.

Find the lexicographically largest array a that can be obtained.

An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b of the same length 
if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the element in 
array a is smaller than the corresponding element in b.
