Codeforces Round 888 (Div. 3) G. Vlad and the Mountains 

Vlad decided to go on a trip to the mountains. He plans to move between n 
mountains, some of which are connected by roads. The i-th mountain has a 
height of h_i.

If there is a road between mountains i and j, Vlad can move from mountain 
i to mountain j by spending h_j - h_i units of energy. If his energy drops 
below zero during the transition, he will not be able to move from 
mountain i to mountain j. Note that h_j - h_i can be negative and then the 
energy will be restored.

Vlad wants to consider different route options, so he asks you to answer 
the following queries: is it possible to construct some route starting at 
mountain a and ending at mountain b, given that he initially has e units 
of energy?
