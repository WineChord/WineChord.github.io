Codeforces Round 898 (Div. 4) F. Money Trees 

Luca is in front of a row of n trees. The i-th tree has a_i fruit and 
height h_i.

He wants to choose a contiguous subarray of the array [h_l, h_{l+1}, 
\dots, h_r] such that for each i (l \leq i &lt; r), h_i is 
divisible^{\dagger} by h_{i+1}. He will collect all the fruit from each of 
the trees in the subarray (that is, he will collect a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots 
+ a_r fruits). However, if he collects more than k fruits in total, he 
will get caught. 

What is the maximum length of a subarray Luca can choose so he doesn't get 
caught?

^{\dagger} x is divisible by y if the ratio \frac{x}{y} is an integer.
