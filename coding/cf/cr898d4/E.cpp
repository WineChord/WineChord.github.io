Codeforces Round 898 (Div. 4) E. Building an Aquarium 

You love fish, that's why you have decided to build an aquarium. You have 
a piece of coral made of n columns, the i-th of which is a_i units tall. 
Afterwards, you will build a tank around the coral as follows: 

 Pick an integer h \geq 1 — the height of the tank. Build walls of height 
h on either side of the tank. 

 Then, fill the tank up with water so that the height of each column is h, 
unless the coral is taller than h; then no water should be added to this 
column. 



 For example, with a=[3,1,2,4,6,2,5] and a height of h=4, you will end up 
using a total of w=8 units of water, as shown. <img class="tex-graphics"

 You can use at most x units of water to fill up the tank, but you want to 
build the biggest tank possible. What is the largest value of h you can 
select?
