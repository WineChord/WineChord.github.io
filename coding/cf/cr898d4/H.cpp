Codeforces Round 898 (Div. 4) H. Mad City 

Marcel and Valeriu are in the mad city, which is represented by n 
buildings with n two-way roads between them. 

Marcel and Valeriu start at buildings a and b respectively. Marcel wants 
to catch Valeriu, in other words, be in the same building as him or meet 
on the same road. 

During each move, they choose to go to an adjacent building of their 
current one or stay in the same building. Because Valeriu knows Marcel so 
well, Valeriu can predict where Marcel will go in the next move. Valeriu 
can use this information to make his move. They start and end the move at 
the same time.

It is guaranteed that any pair of buildings is connected by some path and 
there is at most one road between any pair of buildings.

Assuming both players play optimally, answer if Valeriu has a strategy to 
indefinitely escape Marcel.
