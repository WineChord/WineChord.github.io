Educational Codeforces Round 152 (Rated for Div. 2) B. Monsters 

Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. And yet again, his 
character is killing some monsters. There are n monsters, numbered from 1 
to n, and the i-th of them has a_i health points initially.

Monocarp's character has an ability that deals k damage to the monster 
with the highest current health. If there are several of them, the one 
with the smaller index is chosen. If a monster's health becomes less than 
or equal to 0 after Monocarp uses his ability, then it dies.

Monocarp uses his ability until all monsters die. Your task is to 
determine the order in which monsters will die.
