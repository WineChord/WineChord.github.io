Codeforces Round 280 (Div. 2) B. Vanya and Lanterns 

Vanya walks late at night along a straight street of length l, lit by n 
lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street 
corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. 
Then the i-th lantern is at the point a_i. The lantern lights all points 
of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is 
some positive number, common for all lanterns. 

Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have 
to light the whole street?
