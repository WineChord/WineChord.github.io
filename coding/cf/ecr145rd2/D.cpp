Educational Codeforces Round 145 (Rated for Div. 2) D. Binary String Sorting 

You are given a binary string s consisting of only characters 0 and/or 1.

You can perform several operations on this string (possibly zero). There 
are two types of operations: 

 choose two consecutive elements and swap them. In order to perform this 
operation, you pay 10^{12} coins; 

 choose any element from the string and remove it. In order to perform 
this operation, you pay 10^{12}+1 coins. 

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of coins required to sort the 
string s in non-decreasing order (i.â€‰e. transform s so that s_1 \le s_2 
\le \dots \le s_m, where m is the length of the string after applying all 
operations). An empty string is also considered sorted in non-decreasing 
order.
